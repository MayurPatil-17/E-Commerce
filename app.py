This pie chart shows the sentiment distribution of customer reviews.  
Key Segments:

1-Positive Sentiment (Blue): This is the largest portion, representing 10.43K ratings, which is 49.7% of the total. This means almost half of the ratings are positive.
2-Negative Sentiment (Dark Blue): This is the second largest, with 8.31K ratings, making up 39.58% of the total. This indicates a significant portion of ratings are negative.
3-Neutral Sentiment (Orange): This is the smallest segment, with 2.25K ratings, accounting for 10.72% of the total. This suggests a smaller number of ratings are neutral.

This bar chart compares the number of reviews across different product categories.  
Key Segments (Review Counts by Rating):

1-Star Rating (Dark Green, Longest Bar): This is the most frequent rating, with a very high count of 13.1K reviews. This indicates a significant number of very negative experiences.
2-Star Rating (Dark Green, Above 1-Star): This rating received 1.4K reviews, indicating a moderate number of negative experiences.
3-Star Rating (Dark Green, Smallest Bar): This is the least frequent rating, with 0.9K reviews. This suggests very few customers had a neutral or average experience.
4-Star Rating (Dark Green, Below 5-Star): This rating received 1.3K reviews, showing a decent number of positive, but not perfect, experiences.
5-Star Rating (Dark Green, Second Longest Bar at Top): This is the second most frequent rating, with 4.5K reviews. This shows a notable number of very positive experiences.

This line graph shows review volume trends over time.  
Key Trends:

1-Initial Stability (Pre-2010): The polarity score was near zero or very low, indicating neutral or no significant sentiment activity.
2-First Major Positive Peak (Around 2012): There's a significant surge in positive polarity, peaking at nearly 400. This suggests a period of very strong positive sentiment.
3-Decline and Minor Fluctuation (2013-2015): After the peak, the polarity score drops sharply but remains positive, with a smaller bump around 2015.
4-Second Positive Wave (Around 2017-2019): Another substantial wave of positive polarity emerges, reaching a peak of around 180-190. This indicates a strong period of positive sentiment, though not as high as the 2012 peak.
5-Decline to Negative (Late 2019 - Early 2020): The polarity score starts to decline significantly, crossing the zero line and moving into negative territory. This marks a shift from generally positive to negative sentiment.
6-Sustained Negative Polarity (2020-Present): From approximately 2020 onwards, the polarity score remains consistently negative, fluctuating between -50 and -100. This suggests a period of overall negative sentiment.

Word cloud of most common words in positive reviews.  
Key Observations by Region:

1-Europe (Highly Concentrated): There is a very high concentration of blue circles, many of them large, particularly in Western Europe (e.g., UK, France, Germany, Spain, Italy). This suggests a significant volume of sentiment data originates from this region. The largest circle on the map appears to be in Europe, indicating the highest concentration of sentiment.
2-North America (Significant Activity): The United States and parts of Canada show several large blue circles, indicating a substantial amount of sentiment activity.
3-Asia (Moderate to Scattered): While there are many smaller circles across Asia, there are a few larger ones, notably in India and possibly parts of Southeast Asia. This suggests varying levels of sentiment data across the continent.
4-South America (Moderate Activity): Several circles are visible in South America, particularly along the coastlines, indicating a decent amount of sentiment data.
5-Australia (Visible Activity): Australia shows some visible blue circles, suggesting sentiment data from this region.
6-Africa (Scattered, Smaller): While there are some circles, they appear generally smaller and more scattered across Africa, indicating a lower volume of sentiment data compared to other major continents.
Interpreting Circle Size: Larger blue circles likely represent countries or regions with a higher volume of reviews, mentions, or overall data related to the sentiment being tracked. Smaller circles indicate less data.

This scatter plot shows top reviewers ranked by review count and activity frequency.  
1-Most Active Reviewers:

-The reviewer named "customer" has written the most reviews, with a count of 34. This might indicate a generic name for a large group of anonymous reviewers or a placeholder.
-"David" is the second most active reviewer, with 24 reviews.
-"Mark" follows with 20 reviews.
    
2-Moderately Active Reviewers:

-"John" and "Paul" both have 18 reviews each.
-"Chris" and "Michael" each have 16 reviews.
-"James" has 15 reviews.
-"Mike" has 13 reviews.

3-Least Active Listed Reviewer:

-The reviewer named "Consumer" has the fewest reviews among those shown, with only 6. This, like "customer," could also be a generic label.

This heatmap highlights correlation between different review features.  
1 - Peak Rating:

The highest average rating occurs in February, peaking at approximately 2.41.
Lowest Rating:
sThe lowest average rating occurs in August, dropping significantly to just under 2.0.

2 - Seasonal Trends:

Early Year (January-February): Ratings start relatively high and peak in February.
Spring Decline (March-May): There's a notable dip in March, followed by a slight recovery in April and May, but still lower than the February peak.
Summer Drop (June-August): Ratings generally decline through June and July, hitting their lowest point in August. This suggests a significant drop in customer satisfaction during the summer months.
Autumn Recovery (September-October): There's a clear recovery in ratings from September, peaking again in October.
Year-End Decline (November-December): Ratings slightly decline towards the end of the year, in November and December.
